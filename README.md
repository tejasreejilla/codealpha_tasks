Brief Overview of the Enhanced Network Sniffer Project
The Enhanced Network Sniffer project is a Python-based tool designed to capture, analyze, and visualize real-time network traffic. It provides a deeper understanding of how data flows on a network, how packets are structured, and the ability to monitor and detect potential anomalies or threats.

Key Features
Real-Time Packet Capture:

Listens to network traffic and captures packets using Python's Scapy library.
Captures details such as source and destination IP addresses, protocols, and ports.

Packet Analysis:

Identifies the protocol (TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.) used in each packet.
Displays captured data in a structured and readable format for analysis.

User-Friendly Design:

Modular code structure to separate different functionalities like packet capture, analysis, and logging.
Uses threading for efficient and simultaneous tasks.

Technologies and Tools Used
Python: Programming language used for building the sniffer.
Scapy: A powerful Python library for packet sniffing and analysis.
